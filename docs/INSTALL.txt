slc.treecategories Installation
---------------------------

With zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``slc.treecategories`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        slc.treecategories
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        slc.treecategories
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
